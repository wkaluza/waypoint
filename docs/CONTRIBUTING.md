## Introduction

We welcome contributions from the Community, whether they are defect
reports, new feature proposals, or code changes.

To avoid wasted effort, get in touch (e.g. submit an issue) before
making changes.
Sometimes a discussion is required to determine what the best approach
is, or even if a change makes sense in the first place.
In particular, changes that radically alter Waypoint's behaviour, or
which do not align with our long-term vision will not be accepted.

In closing, let us be clear that we evaluate contributions
individually on merit.
In particular, neither your sponsor status nor time served as a
Community member guarantee that a pull request will be merged or an
issue implemented.

## Development

As Waypoint currently has no dependencies, this repository is all you
need for development work.

Waypoint is a CMake project.
Make sure you have CMake installed to build it.

All source files are encoded using UTF-8.

### Development on Linux

On Linux, development is best carried out in a Docker container;
see the files in `infrastructure/docker` for details of the
environment.
To start using the container, make sure you have docker installed and
enabled for `sudo`-less execution.
Run `scripts/enter_docker.bash` in a terminal.
This script will build a Docker image with all the necessary
tooling and start a terminal session inside the container.

TODO describe using the build script

### The pre-commit hook

Waypoint comes with a helpful pre-commit hook that will keep you from
falling foul of some of the checks performed during the build.
It is a Python script in `scripts/git_pre_commit_hook.py`;
among other things, it checks if your sources are correctly formatted
and makes sure that you update the notice of copyright in the files
you change.
All you have to do to use it is have Git's pre-commit hook invoke
this script.

A minimal pre-commit hook on Linux would be the following (make sure
the `pre-commit` file is executable).

`.git/hooks/pre-commit`

```shell
#!/bin/sh
python3 "$(pwd)/scripts/git_pre_commit_hook.py"
```
